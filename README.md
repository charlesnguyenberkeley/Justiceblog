## A Perspective of Homelessness in The Bay Area

Homelessness population in recent years in the Bay Area is increasing quicker. Regarding the “Bay Area Homelessness: New Urgency, New Solutions” report that I retrieved from Bay Area Council Economic Institute at http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/bay-area-homelessness/, between 2017 and 2020, the Bay Area’s homelessness population increased 6,878 people to a total of 35,118. This number reflects the increase for more than a quarter of the growth in the total U.S. homlessness population.
